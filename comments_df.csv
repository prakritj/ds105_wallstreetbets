The way we use that to our advantage is to realize that there's all sorts of mega pumps going on using options as we've seen with TSLA the previous couple of weeks with tens of billions of dollars flooding the option chain and forcing the stock up; now it's spreading throughout Tech.  Try to spot them early on popular names (EVs, Metaverse, Big Tech) and ride them.

The option ramps get more steep near the end of the week like we saw with today's action on SHOP and RBLX because it's easy when those OTM options are nearly worthless to buy and all of a sudden gain value requiring steep hedging.

I fully expect a lot more of these if we keep seeing this level of volume (stock and options).  Just try to keep an eye on what's popping really early in the first 5-10 minutes and see if there's something going on in the option chain as well.",16.0

Pick any non dividend paying stock and place the following complex order. For the Jan 2024 contracts, buy the ATM puts, sell the same strike ATM calls and buy the underlying. 

Take PLTR for example, the stock finished at 22.83, the ATM $23 calls are 7.7 and the ATM $23 puts are 7.21. 

I buy the stock and puts and sell the calls so the total debit will be 22.83+7.21-7.7=22.34x100 using the quotes from yahoo finance. 

In January of 2024, if PLTR is above $23 I will be assigned and will receive $2300 for a net profit of $66 and my puts expire worthless. If PLTR is below $23 the calls I sold expire worthless and I exercise my puts selling my shares for a price of $23 each once again receiving $2300 and a profit of $66. 

With any *non dividend* paying stock you find, it will always be about 2-3% for the Jan 2024 depending on the quotes you see at the time.

1515,hkdspwk,t3_qskqik,"TIFU by shaving my butthole  
  
This happened a few days ago, but the effects have only become truly apparent in the last day or so.  
  
As a man, I always found it deeply unfair that genetics would grant me a paucity of hair on my chin, but an abundance in my arsecrack. Equally, it seemed some odd evolutionary jest that we should need hair around our buttholes. It makes about as much sense to me as trying to clean peanut butter from a hessian rug with a piece of tissue paper. What possible reason could I have for needing hair there?  
  
With these thoughts in mind, I decided it was time to defy God and his cruel designs, and shave my asshole. Things were great for about an hour, and the regret began to settle in.  
  
Let me educate you about the things you might expect if you decide to follow my path:  
  
My farts now come out of the top of my ass crack. With the hair that previously prevented my cheeks from forming a seal removed, my farts now form a cavity of air that travels up my ass crack and out the top. This is very unnerving. Sort of like having your farts walk up your back.  
  
Friction. This should have been obvious and I was a fool to miss it. My butt cheeks now rub together, and while it isn't chafing or painful, it feels weird and I'm not getting used to it.  
  
Stubble. Oh my god, the stubble. I used a razor to shave, and now I have the homegrown equivalent of a brillo pad tearing my delicate ring apart. When it isn't scratchy, it's itchy. And it's itching my actual asshole, not just the cheeks. This is the part I'm currently suffering from the most.  
  
Needless to say, all this friction against my tight little starfish has induced numerous unwanted orgasms both in public and at home. Fellow Redditors be warned, if you don't want to jizz your pants when the cute underage cashier at the grocery store smiles at you because your jeans chafed against your freshly-shaven crack, causing you to suddenly fantasize about her pegging you, do not make the same mistake as me.

1862,hkga2rs,t3_qskqik,"If China invaded Taiwan, the reason the US would go to war with them has nothing to do with Taiwanese ""independence."" The argument isn't about whether Taiwan is part of China or its own country, the argument is about whether Taiwan is part of China or both Taiwan and China are part of the US.

If the Chinese government sends its military to kill Taiwanese people and occupy Taiwan then that would be the Chinese government submitting its formal Declaration of Independence from the globalist overlords.

If Xi just wrote a letter to Vlad saying ""I declare independence from the globalists"" the response would not be to send in redcoats and have a revolutionary war. That doesn't work on one of the world's oldest empires with a 10 digit population count and one of the biggest and most advanced militaries in the world. The response would be to pat Xi on the head and say ""that's so cute, let me put that right on the fridge"" then vastly ramp up economic manipulation, espionage, border restrictiveness around China, maybe covertly assassinate some friends of Xi, and make him agree to a public meeting where he bends the knee and backs down. Don't forget to make him smile while he shakes hands with you for the cameras, Vlad. Remind him who he really is and what his place is. Fuck his wife. Xi has no balls.

However, if the next declaration of Chinese independence comes in the form of a war over Taiwan, then Xi is saying ""I'm tired of you fucking my wife, look at my balls."" And then the response will not be to pat anyone on the head, put anything on the fridge, or be covert. The response will be ""OK, we take you seriously now and we'll consider letting China keep its territory to itself and have independence after all this, but you're trying to shit with your head up your ass if you think we're going to let you have Taiwan when you know full well Taiwan is one of our most important strategic assets, especially against you.""

The conflict will end, possibly before violence even erupts, with an unwritten agreement that Xi can stop following orders from Vlad in exchange for shutting the fuck up about Taiwan and accepting that it's not a part of China anymore. Or, looking at it from the reverse angle, Vlad can have Taiwan if he stops demanding Xi follow his whims over every domestic matter in mainland China. At the same time, written agreements will come out alluding to this deal, with publicly defined terms reflecting the true underlying promise between world leaders.

\---

I've been looking at Evergrande's USD bonds that expiry in March and April of 2022. They basically just have one last coupon payment left + the face value of the bond to be paid back to the bond holders.

As far as I've understood [Goldman Sachs likely has some positions in these](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-08/goldman-bets-that-fears-of-chinese-real-estate-debt-are-overdone). Does anyone else think these would be good play as it really is very likely that at least in short term China will do anything (rip off the money from their rich) to pay these junk bonds, to save their real estate market.

Fundamentally it's bit weird position to take, as it is very likely that China's real estate market will go through some form of radical crash and reform on the long term. As they literally have build ghost cities with bare bones buildings, that people buy as investments that don't even generate rental income. But considering you took positions on the March and April 2022 bonds that will mature relatively soon, it's completely possible that you could get paid handsomely when the bonds are paid back with the face value. Also considering that after all it's senior debt, it's very likely some form of bailout in case of bankruptcy would save some of your money anyway.

Of course Evergrande is heavily in debt ($300B+), but considering that we're talking about China, is it really that much and how easily China could bail them out (especially if in true communist way they take the money from their people)?

These bonds are trading around 30$, while the face value is 100$. So significant gains, considering it is senior debt after all. Of course this is in the #YOLO territory, because there's not many bonds priced at these kind of discounts for a good reason.

I'm still bit cautious about this idea, because I haven't invested into bonds previously, so I might be missing something here. Generally bonds are what boomers buy because it gives cover from inflation compared to just holding cash. But I feel like now is the opportunity to go degenerate with YOLO Junk Bonds if ever. If we're heading into another bull run after small dip we had this week and I manage to make 10k+ in couple weeks, I'll definitely look into putting 3-9k into these bonds, assuming the current valuation stays as it is and the overall situation stays somewhat stable.",1.0
