*Need to add a TLDR; do so at the end*
# Exploring the Jungle of r/WSB

*talk about context - why is this important, general happenings over the last 12 months that make this important*

Over the last 12 months, there has been a seismic increase in followers of the Reddit community (known as a *subreddit*) [r/WallStreetBets](https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets). As a group of retail investors (but each operating on their own accord), these followers collectively invested in stocks on the US market, coordinating through Reddit forums. *carry on about impact on the mainstream financial industry, subscriber growth, how active they are on Reddit, etc.) Cite some articles and data supporting this*

*what motivated us* As observers of these trends, we wanted to further understand them for two reasons. Firstly, as a collective group of retail investors, r/WSB was able to rattle the financial industry despite their vast access to financial capital and real-time information acted upon by professionals. Secondly, we saw that many of these investors were pouring their life savings (and significant amounts *show screenshots from r/WSB here*) into many companies advocated for on the platform. These investments are often unconventional, and financial professionals/ratings firms don't share many of the views of the community. The question then is: who's right? Are r/WSB investors throwing their money away or have they proved institutional investors wrong? To answer this, we needed to do a deeper analysis of the r/WSB community, what is being said on these forums, and understand the stocks that they are advocating for to identify patterns and performance trends. *need to expand a bit more on this, with some evidence, etc.*
