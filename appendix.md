In writing and developing our project, we used a number of resources online. Thank you to all who maintain or contribute to the upkeep and production of these resources. See a list of these resources (in no particular order) below.

- Data from [Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets) was retrieved using [Python Reddit API Wrapper (PRAW)](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
- In developing our interactive visualisation components, we utilised the [D3.js (Data-Driven Documents) Javascript library](https://d3js.org).
- [This tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPr60pexvEM) by Jonathan Soma helped us develop our Javascript elements and integrate them into our webpage.

- Financial Data was obtained from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com) using the [yfinance Python package](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/).
- Sentiment Analysis referenced the AFINN Lexicon. The version we used is accessible [here](https://github.com/prakritj/ds105_wsb/blob/main/AFINN_english.txt).
- We used the [Python NLTK package](https://www.nltk.org) and the [Readability package](https://pypi.org/project/readability/) for our textual analysis, such as to calculate Flesch-Kincaid Reading Level.
